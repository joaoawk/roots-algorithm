# What's up in here?

This is an implementation of bissection method to find roots in a given interval.

## What's the purpose?

I intended to practice and memorize the algorithm. And which way is better than doing it by hand? You can implement it by specifing the mathematical function in _f_ and the interval in _interval_.

## Scalability

I also do not intend to make it far than this, since there are many algorithms worldwide, I will not change a thing, but refactor the code, applying, as always, good programming practices.
